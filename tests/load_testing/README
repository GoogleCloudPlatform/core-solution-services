This is a locust file for testing a genie instance.
To use it install the required packages by running `pip3 -r requirements.txt` from within this folder.  
Then copy the file named `example_config.py` in the same folder and name the copy `config.py`.  
Then enter the username and password for an account on the target genie instance in the 
USERNAME and PASSWORD global variables in the file `config.py`.  
A username and password can be created in the target instance's firebase instance
by adding an email/password user.  
Enter the address of your genie instance api backend as the BASE_URL variable.  
Then run the command `locust --host localhost` from this directory and navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:8089/`.
You should be presented with a page with a start button.  
Click start and the results should start streaming in!
