      "The methodologies and development of the loads experienced during liftoff of the NASA SLS Block I vehicle will be presented in this paper.  The liftoff loads analysis traditionally captures the dynamics of vehicle/pad separation after engine/booster ignition coupled with other launch day environments like wind, overpressure, and engine side loads. Additionally, the liftoff analysis includes an on-pad engine shutdown prior to booster ignition. The SLS liftoff analysis is performed using a Monte Carlo analysis and this paper will explore the Monte Carlo process and the statistical approach to calculating the limit loads.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Space Launch System (SLS), composed of the Booster, Core Stage, Integrated Spacecraft and Payload Element,  is the first super-heavy launch vehicle developed by NASA since the Saturn V.  SLS, its accompanying Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) spacecraft, and the Mobile Launcher (ML) experience complex loading conditions during the liftoff event.  The nominal liftoff analysis was broken into two sub-events based on a Core Stage element request for results separated into before and after Booster ignition. The two sub events are designated Build Up (BU) for the period that spans Core Stage Engine (CSE) build up until T=0s and the Booster Ignition (IG) that spans T=0s to tower clearance (T=~7s).  The on-pad shutdown (SD) analysis was treated as a third sub-event and covers the scenario where the Core engines are started and commanded to stop at some point prior to Booster ignition. In this case, Booster ignition does not occur and so the vehicle stabilizer (VS) remains connected throughout the entire analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The liftoff analysis is performed using a Monte Carlo (MC) approach.  The BU and IG sub-events are performed with a 5000 case Monte Carlo.  For each MC case, the BU and IG portion represent one continuous liftoff case. The SD sub-event is performed with a separate 2000 case MC.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\tModeling\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe integrated SLS Finite Element Models (FEMs) were produced by integrating the element Craig-Bampton (CB) reduced models within NASTRAN.  For the SLS liftoff analysis, the element models used were the ML, Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), the Core Stage (CS), the Launch Vehicle Stage Adapter (LVSA), the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS), the MPCV Stage Adapter (MSA), and the Orion MPCV.  These element models have all been validated through element level static and dynamic testing.  Each element model delivery also included Load Transformation Matrices (LTMs), and additional integrated vehicle LTMs were generated by the Integrated Vehicle Loads Team at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC).  \n",
      "\n",
      "\tOnce the integrated models have been produced, the Liftoff team processes the models for use in the liftoff Coupled Loads Analysis (CLA). A secondary model truncation process is performed in order to remove the high frequency normal modes that are included in the CB models.  Modal truncation with residual vector augmentation is used to reduce the CB models for use in the liftoff simulation.  In practice, the residual vectors are treated statically which essentially makes the process equivalent to the mode acceleration method.  The residual vector augmentation method is preferred to the mode acceleration method due to the ease of implementation in regard to the non-linear change in boundary conditions as the vehicle leaves the ML. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tTo simulate the vehicle leaving the ML during the IG portion of the analysis, the equations of motion for the ML and vehicle are integrated separately with the interface forces between the two bodies applied in an equal and opposite manner.  This allows the force to be set to zero when the simulation predicts the interface grids have lost contact.  This means that for the IG portion of the CLA, the vehicle and ML models are processed separately and that each model undergoes a separate secondary model reduction with residual vector augmentation.  The BU and SD models are handled differently than the models for IG.  During the BU and SD portion of the analysis, the vehicle remains in contact with the ML for the duration of the event.  This allows for the use of coupled vehicle/ML models which significantly decreases the simulation run time compared to the IG process.     \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\tInitial Conditions\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial conditions (ICs) for the BU and SD sub-events include both static and dynamic initial conditions.  Static ICs refer to displacements due to static forces (gravity and preloads) and dynamic ICs refer to both displacement and velocity ICs from a dynamic simulation.  For BU and SD, the dynamic portion of the ICs are derived from the wind analysis performed by the Prelaunch team.  The Prelaunch team uses the same liftoff CB model but uses a different secondary reduction in their analysis.  This requires that the CB displacement, velocity, and accelerations from the prelaunch wind analysis be converted into the liftoff modal coordinates. First, a pseudo-inverse is used to convert the acceleration and velocity by\n",

For the IG sub-event, the initial conditions include only dynamic ICs that are converted from the BU sub-event.  The conversion is done in a similar manner to the wind ICs in BU using Equations 1-3.  The conversion is performed at T= -0.1s in order to have a small amount of overlap between the BU and IG simulations.  The overlap helps verify that the conversion was successful and allows the IG simulation to find the correct equilibrium if there are any small numerical inconsistencies at the conversion time.  \n",

      "\tExternally applied vehicle loads in this analysis included gravity, wind, thrust, CSE startup side loads, CSE hydrogen pop, CSE thrust oscillation, gimbal steering forces, overpressure, and dynamically released stacking and cryogenic preloads. The wind forcing functions are delivered as a set of force time histories for both the 1-hour wind (Ground Wind Gust—GWG) and the tuned vortex shedding (Wind Induced Oscillation—WIO) case. For each wind level, wind forcing functions are provided for wind directions from 0° to 330° in 30° increments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThrust forcing functions for both the SRBs and the CSE were used in the simulation.  The MODEL5V ballistics model is used to generate sea level booster thrust and absolute pressure at 17 discrete zones within the SRB motor.  A set of 5000 matched pairs were created using MODEL5V, and then converted to net thrust and gage pressure to be used in the liftoff analysis.  During this conversion, scaling is performed to match the net thrust, thrust imbalance, and expected motor stretch when the forcing function is applied to the SRB finite element model. An example of the booster thrust internal pressure transients are shown in Figure 1.\n",

      "\tIn addition to the CSE thrust, there were several environments induced by the CSE startup. First, CSE startup side loads result from unsteady flow dynamics during startup of a liquid engine.  The side loads result in a lateral reaction load on the nozzle bell that can be treated as a set of net loads acting on the gimbals. Forcing functions to represent the effects of this phenomenon, consisting of moments and lateral forces, were applied to the vehicle side of the engine gimbal locations during the BU analysis.  Second, a steep-fronted overpressure wave, termed hydrogen pop, is applied to the vehicle in the simulation. Core stage engines are fuel-lead engines meaning that free hydrogen exits the nozzle for 900ms nominally after the start command.  Long-throw pyrotechnic igniters near the exit plane of the nozzles are used to ignite the built-up hydrogen just prior to engine ignition which produces the steep-fronted overpressure wave.  An example of the hydrogen pop is shown in Figure 3. Finally, CSE thrust oscillation (TO) is applied in the simulation. CSE TO accounts for the low frequency (0-100 Hz) oscillatory thrust from the RS-25 CSE.  These forcing functions were derived from high-speed data captured during heritage Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) tests.  The CSE TO forcing functions were provided as Power Spectral Density (PSD) and converted to the time domain for use in the Monte Carlo analysis. \n",

Error sources, such as thrust vector misalignment (booster: DTV, core: CSE misalignment models), are then added as biases to the commanded angles to result in the total thrust vector angle, α. An example of the resulting gimbal angles, including the biases, is shown in Figure 4.\n",

      "\tIn addition to the nozzle gimbaling forces, both the SRBs and CSE ignition produce overpressure waves that impact the vehicle. Ignition overpressure is a fluid dynamic phenomenon caused by the rapid filling of a rocket exhaust plume into the exhaust duct during the ignition event.  A series of pressure waves are formed and then travel throughout and reflect in the exhaust duct and trench.  The waves superimpose and propagate out of the duct inlet and exit, impinging on the vehicle and surrounding structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tFinally, a set of preloads are used in the simulations.  Due to stacking procedures and environmental factors, the nominal geometry in the FEMs does not perfectly reflect the unloaded geometry of the vehicle.  In the model, the stabilizer and Booster aft attach struts are connected to the vehicle geometry under no load.  As a result, when gravity loads are applied to the prelaunch model, interface forces are created at the Booster aft attach and Stabilizer interfaces that should not be present.  The stacking procedures dictate that the aft attach struts and stabilizer struts are attached to the gravity deformed vehicle such that no load is carried by the struts.  There must therefore be some adjustment to the nominal strut lengths to eliminate these interface loads due to gravity after stacking. A set of preloads referred to as the untie loads are determined that adjust the nominal strut lengths such that there are no strut loads with gravity applied to the model.  Additional sources of preloads are due to booster toe-in during stacking and stacking tolerances, boundary condition changes upon crawler pickup, and core shrinkage due to cryogenic effects upon liquid hydrogen (LH2) fueling.\n",

The Flight Readiness Analysis Cycle (FRAC) analysis recovered nearly 200,000 rows from the element provided LTMs.  A subset of the recoveries was used as Critical Load Indicators (CLI) to allow a timely assessment of the SLS vehicle structural health status with respect to the FRAC loads.  A summary of the FRAC results, and comparisons to the design loads captured in SLS-RQMT-045-01 Revision E, Cross Program Vehicle Design Environments, Integrated Vehicle Loads Volume 1: SLS Block 1, and the previous Verification Analysis Cycle 1 – Reintegration (VAC1R) results, is shown in Figure 5 thru Figure 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThe liftoff FRAC results are similar to the VAC1R results and below the design loads for most of the vehicle.  In general, the liftoff loads only set design limits at the aft end of the vehicle.  This is the result of the eccentric loading due to engine stagger during BU and SD and is apparent in the Y and Z moment plots.  The remaining portions of the vehicle are generally driven by flight, or ascent, loads.    \n",
